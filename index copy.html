            <p>The web was created in the early 1990s and is estimated to be 30 billion
            pages. The main components of the web are the <b>Internet</b>, a <b>browser</b>,
            <b>servers</b>, and <b>HTTP</b>. HTTP is the main protocol of the web,
            and servers are computers that host files on the web. The Internet is the
            World's largest computer network, and a browser is a program that can display
            files that are found on the web.  The browser, such as <em>Firefox</em>.
            <em>Chrome</em>, <em>Safari</em>, <em>Edge</em>, or <em>Microsoft Explorer</em>,
            makes requests via the HTTP protocol to display / render pages that are hosted
            on servers.

            <h2>The Basics of HTML</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to HTML Tags</h3>
            <img src="images/htmltags.png" class="round" alt="html tags pic">
            <p>HTML is text content (what you see), markup (what it looks like), and any
            references to images, videos, and links to other pages. To make HTML look
            different, tags are used. The first tag is called the opening tag and consists
            of the tag name enclosed by a less than symbol &#40;&lt;&#41; and a greater than
            symbol &#40;&gt;&#41;. Then there are the contents, and on the other side is the
            closing tag, which is made up of a less than symbol, a slash &#40;&#47;&#41;, the
            tag name, and a greater than symbol. The whole structure is referred to as an
            <em>element</em>. So, for example, a header one element will look something like
            this: &lt;h1&gt;Your Header Here&lt;&#47;h1&gt;. There are other types of tags
            such as the &lt;b&gt; tag, which can <b>bold</b> text, and the &lt;em&gt; tag, which
            will display text in <em>italics</em>.

            <h3>Advanced HTML Tags</h3>
            <p>An HTML tag can contain an attribute. Attributes always equal a value.
            Additionally, tags can have multiple attributes. An example of a tag that uses
            an attribute is called the anchor tag. The anchor tag &lt;a&gt; can link a word or
            a phrase to a webpage such as this: <a href="www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>. Displayed
            in a browser, the word "Udacity" is linked to the Udacity homepage.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="advhtmltagstext">
            <p>Another advanced HTML tag is the image tag. The img tag structure
            includes the source for the image in the form of an URL or a reference to a file
            location. There is also an alt component of the tag that includes the text that
            is displayed when the image doesn't load. So, if the URL doesn't exist, the text will
            display instead. Also, this type of tag is called a <b>void</b> tag and has no ending
            slash. It is void because it has no content.

            <p>There are a lot of details to remember about HTML. Fortunately, many resources
            exist on the web. Some of these include the <em>Mozilla Developer Network</em>
            and their section on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">

            <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
            <p>In HTML, text on multiples lines will render on a single line.  In order to
            use multiple lines, there must be a line break. A line break is acheived by
            using the break tag, and is a <em>void</em> tag. Another way to achieve a
            line break is by using the paragraph tag. The paragraph tag is not considered
            a void tag because it has content. When using the paragraph tag, there will
            be a space between each paragraph.
            </p>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="inlineblock">
        <div class="inlineblocktext">
            <h3>Inline vs. Block Elements</h3>
            <p>When writing text in HTML, there can be as many spaces as you'd like between
            the words, but it will always render as a single space between each word. The
            sames goes for text that is broken up over several lines; it will still render
            on a single line. The break tag &lt;br&gt; is an inline tag. It ends a line and
            everything that comes after will wrap to the next line. For example: <br>
            <br>
            Here is one line...<br>
            And here is another line...<br>
            <br>
            On the other hand, the paragraph tag, which also forces a line break, creates
            an invisible box that has <em>height</em> and <em>width</em>. Some examples of
            inline elements are the bold tag, the emphasis tag, and the image tag.
            </p>
            <p>Two additional elements are the span tag and div tag. The span element creates
            inline container, whereas the div element creates a box container. Attributes
            can be added to each of these elements. A type of attribute that can be added
            to each is <em>class</em>, which is <b>CSS</b>. CSS dictates the style of the
            resulting HTML page. The inline elments include span, a, br, img, and strong. Some
            block elements are div, p, and form.

            contains the title, can also include <em>meta-data</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>,
            and <em>CSS</em>. The body tag contains the actual content of the page. The
            majority of this course will focus on what is between the body tags.

            <h3>The Basics of CSS</h3>
            <img src="images/css.png" class="round" alt="css pic">
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML. Using the following analogy,
            HTML can be thought of as the structure of a house, such as its walls. Style would
            then be the color of the paint used on the walls or the type of flooring used
            throughout the house. Additionally, JavaScript is the functionality of a webpage,
            so using the house analogy, it would be something like a garage door opener or a
            remote control for the television.
            </p>
            <p>When writing CSS, a <em>Selector</em> must first be chosen. Basically, when
            a selector is indicated in the code, all of the rules written for it will be applied
            in the HTML document. So, if h1 is chosen as the selector and the CSS rules indicate
            that the background color is black and the text color is blue, this will apply to
            all h1 elements.
            </p>
            <span>Here are some important CSS definitions:</span>
            <ul>
              <li>The <b>Rule</b> is the CSS code that describes the value an attribute should
              take.</li>
              <li>The <b>Property</b> is what you want to change.</li>
              <li>The <b>Value</b> is what is assigned to the attribute.</li>
              <li>The <b>Selector</b> is a name chosen by the programmer to target elements that
              are assigned to an id attribute or a class in HTML.</li>
              <li>The <b>Class</b> is a group of elements that can be styled together. When using
              Class names, there should be no periods or any other punctuation marks.</li>
              <li>The <b>ID</b> is a unique identifier for an element in the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Advanced CSS Topics</h3>
            <p>In the example above, the CSS rule was applied to every header in the HTML doc.
            what do we do if we only want to apply certain rules to certain h1's? To answer this
            question, class selectors must be used. When a class is selected in HTML, it allows the
            programmer to specifically target that class, or portion of the HTML doc, for specific
            CSS styling rules. This allows for greater flexibility in styling a HTML document.
            </p>
            <span>There are three ways that CSS can be added to HTML:</span>
            <ol>
              <li>Add a &lt;head&gt; element and include a &lt;style&gt; element. In the &lt;style&gt;
              element, write the CSS code for the document.</li>
              <li>Write the CSS code inline with the HTML. This is regarded as the worst option.
              It is bad because the programmer will have to write a lot of repeated code, and
              when code is repeatedly written, it can lead to mistakes.</li>
              <li>Write a separate CSS file and link it to the HTML file. This is regarded as best
              method to include style because it allows the programmer to stay organized.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="images/csstohtml.jpg" class="small" alt="csstohtml pic">
            <p>It is important to note that if a programmer choses to write a separate CSS file and
            link it to the HTML file, then both files (and any images) must be contained within the
            same master project folder. Lastly, check your HTML and CSS files with the
            <a href="https://validator.w3.org">HTML validator</a> and the
            <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a> to make sure the code is
            written correctly!

             <h3>The Box Model</h3>
             <p>Everything on a webpage is composed of boxes. However, before these boxes can be
             positioned and/or re-shaped on a webpage, it is first helpful to understand the box
             model.
             </p>
             <img src="images/theboxmodel.png" class="small" alt="theboxmodel pic">
         </div>
         <div>
             <span>The box is made of up four components:</span>
             <ol>
               <li><b>Content</b>: Image or text that appears on the webpage. The layers that surround
               it can be viewed as protection, so boxes do not sit too close to each other.</li>
               <li><b>Padding</b>: Clears an area around the content.</li>
               <li><b>Border</b>: Goes around the padding and content.</li>
               <li><b>Margin</b>: Clears an area around the border. The margin does not have a
               background color. It is completely transparent because it exists as the space between
               boxes.</li>
             </ol>
             <p>The size of the box is equal to the border, padding, and content widths. Additionally,
             box sizes can be set as pixels or as percentages. If the box size is set as a percentage,
             the box size will change depending on the size of the webpage. This will not happen if
             the box size is set in pixels.  The box size will remain the same size as the webpage
             changes. This can lead to a bad user experience.
             </p>
             <p>Moving boxes around is probably one of the most difficult tasks in CSS. One way this
             can be achieved is by using the <em>flex box</em> method. This is an efficient way to
             distribute space among the lines in a container, or div. Adding "display: flex" to the
             appropriate CSS will display divs next to each other.
